Background:
Groundwater, a vital component of Earth's hydrological cycle, plays a crucial role in sustaining various ecosystems and human activities. However, the management of groundwater resources is challenged by factors such as population growth, climate variability, and land use changes. Accurate prediction of groundwater levels is essential for assessing groundwater availability, optimizing resource management strategies, and ensuring sustainable water use practices.

Traditional methods for predicting groundwater levels often rely on simplistic models and limited data, leading to uncertainties in predictions. In contrast, the proposed research project adopts a data-driven approach, leveraging machine learning algorithms, particularly artificial neural networks (ANNs), to develop more accurate and practical prediction models.

The motivation behind this project stems from the need to enhance our understanding of groundwater dynamics and improve prediction capabilities. By comparing the performance of machine learning algorithms with traditional methods, the project seeks to identify the most effective techniques for groundwater level prediction. Additionally, by exploring different prediction horizons and assessing the impact of limited data availability, the research aims to develop robust prediction models adaptable to various temporal and spatial scales.

Furthermore, the initiative focuses on estimating soil moisture levels using groundwater data. Soil moisture is critical in agriculture, hydrology, and environmental monitoring, therefore accurate assessment is required for sustainable land use practices and water resource management.

Overall, the goal of this research project is to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and practical applications by creating trustworthy tools for predicting groundwater and soil moisture levels. By improving our ability to estimate groundwater levels and soil moisture dynamics, the project helps to informed waterresource management decision-making and promotes the sustainable use of existing water resources in a variety of businesses and sectors.
